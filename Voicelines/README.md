Plays sound effects when Hornet takes certain actions.  
Comes with [some sound effects from the first game](./Voicelines/SFX/).

Supports custom sound effects, simply add them to the SFX folder after installing.  
Any [file format supported by Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.2/Documentation/Manual/AudioFiles-compatibility.html) should work.

Multiple sound effects can be selected and it'll pick a random one.  
You can manipulate odds by editing the configuration file.  
Enter sounds multiple times to increase odds or sounds that don't exist for a chance of not playing anything.
